# Cupcake_Order_SwiftUI_ObservableObject

In this project from Paul Hudson's SwiftUI tutorial, we developed a multi-screen app for ordering cakes. We used several forms in this project, but we also learned how to send and receive order data online, how to validate forms, and more. Thank you for this information, Paul Hudson.
